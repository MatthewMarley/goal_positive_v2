What do I actually want to create?
 - Create a chain-system for goals where you are giving something up (e.g. smoking, alcohol, etc),
 or taking up a new daily task (e.g. Go running, play guitar,etc)
    - Index - Shows all chains for everyone (regardless of category), (Using pagination). Can filter by category
        - New - Create a new chain with the following categories
            - Name of Chain (e.g. Go Running, Play Guitar, Cold Shower, NoFap, Programming)
            - User_id - Foreign Key
            - Category_id - Foreign Key
            - Pledge
        - Edit - (for: Name of chain, pledge)
        - Show - Show individual Chain (along with comments)
